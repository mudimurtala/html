    <p>I have something so important to tell you, but you have to
        pay much attention because that's the only way to get me right and understand all i'll be telling
        you. It's very crucial that you are with me 100% during this interim conversation that's
        the most effective way to get good results out of this collaboration. your people have
        for long be thinking that I'm the culprit behind what has happened two
